### 12:34 - please implement spec 02

**Prompt:**
> please implement spec 02

**Result:**
Let me start by reading the spec to understand what needs to be implemented.

This is a substantial multi-phase implementation. Let me explore the reference Zalo extension and the plugin SDK to understand the existing patterns before implementing.

Let me explore the codebase to understand the existing patterns.

Good, I now have a thorough understanding of the codebase. Let me check a few specific details before writing the plan.

Now let me look at the monitor.ts message pipeline in detail, and also check if wechaty is already in the root package.json.

Now I have a thorough understanding of all the patterns. Let me write the implementation plan.
