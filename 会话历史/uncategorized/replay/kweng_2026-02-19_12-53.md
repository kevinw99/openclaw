**Prompt:**
> how do i see if the claude code plugin is working on? I don't see the color code changes for code change

**Result:**
Here are some things to check:

**Which IDE are you using?**

### VS Code
1. Open Extensions (`Cmd+Shift+X`), search "Claude Code", and verify it's installed and enabled
2. Look for the **Spark icon** in the editor toolbar (it only appears when a file is open)
3. When Claude makes changes, you should see a **side-by-side diff view** with green (additions) and red (deletions)

### JetBrains (IntelliJ, PyCharm, etc.)
1. Go to **Settings > Plugins**, search "Claude Code", verify it's installed and enabled
2. Run `claude` from the **integrated terminal** (not an external terminal) — this is required for diffs to show
3. Completely restart the IDE after installing the plugin

### General troubleshooting
- **Restart your IDE** fully (not just close/reopen the window)
- Make sure you're running the **latest version** of the extension
- Test by asking Claude to make a small change (e.g., add a comment to a file) and see if the diff view appears
- If running Claude from an external terminal, use the `/ide` command to connect it to your IDE

Which IDE are you using? That will help narrow down the issue.
