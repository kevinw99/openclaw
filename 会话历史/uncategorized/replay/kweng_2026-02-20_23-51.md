**Prompt:**
> I want to use "Agent Teams / Swarm Mode". Can you turn it on. make it works for all sessions by defualt

**Result:**
Done. Agent Teams (Swarm Mode) is now enabled for all sessions.

**What changed:** Added `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` to `~/.claude/settings.json` so it applies globally.

**Quick usage guide:**
- Ask Claude to "create an agent team" with specific roles and it will spawn teammate agents
- **Shift+Down** to cycle through teammates in your terminal
- **Ctrl+T** to toggle the shared task list
- Each teammate works in its own context window in parallel

Note: This is an experimental feature — it uses significantly more tokens since each teammate is a full Claude Code instance. You'll need to restart your current session for the change to take effect.
