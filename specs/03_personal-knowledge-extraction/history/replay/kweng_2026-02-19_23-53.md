### 23:53 - why task, no spec here

**Prompt:**

> why task, no spec here

**Result:**
You're right — this is a spec, not a task. The distinction:

- **Task**: Operational one-offs — migrations, cleanups, investigations. Short-lived, no design needed.
- **Spec**: Feature development with requirements, design, multiple phases. Lives longer, needs architecture.

"Personal Knowledge Extraction" is clearly a feature with multi-phase development, platform adapters, a plugin architecture. That's a spec.

Want me to move it to `spec/03_personal-knowledge-extraction/` and flesh it out with the full spec template (requirements, design, tasks, status)?
